Ingredients:
- 1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 1 cup chopped hazelnuts
- 3 slices thick-cut bacon, chopped
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 cup dried cranberries
- 1/4 cup grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.

2. Toss Brussels sprouts with olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until coated.
Transfer coated sprouts to a baking sheet.

3. Bake in the preheated oven until sprouts are tender, about 15 minutes.

4. Cook and stir hazelnuts in a skillet over medium-low heat until lightly toasted and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Transfer hazelnuts to a bowl.

5. Cook and stir bacon in the same skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes.
Add maple syrup and rosemary; cook, stirring often, until the bacon drippings and maple syrup begin to thicken and stick to the back of a spook, about 10 minutes.

6. Combine cooked Brussels sprouts and bacon mixture together in a large bowl; toss until sprouts are coated with maple syrup sauce. Sprinkle in hazelnuts, cranberries, and Perocino-Romano cheese; toss well. This dish is best served warm.
